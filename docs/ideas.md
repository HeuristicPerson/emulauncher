### RomConfig saves

When a ROM is launched, the settings are saved:

  1. among the installed game
  2. in the users folder

Then, a second user tries to launch the same game...

  1. The game is installed, so the settings of that installation are loaded.
  2. But the user also had their own settings stored in the user folder. Both
     settings are different. WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

And, another problem, what happens if the settings stored (whether they are the
installation settings or the user settings) are not compatible with the current
system? e.g. a core not available anymore is indicated.
